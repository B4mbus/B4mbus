A guy from Poland wanting to know more about computers, programming and security.
Always lazy, I don't remember having any stuff done.

* If you see any public repository it's a miracle, because that means I got my ass up and did something (or I made an error while configuring repos)
* If you see something else than C++ I prolly lost my mind or started questioning my life choices
* If you see me regurally updating repos - it's prolly not me
* Yeah, I'm lazy

Yeah, and that's all  
:v:
